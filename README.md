# Update May 2024

Moving this out of active development to create this app from scratch based on all the mistakes and learnings from the past year. Will link it here if I ever decide to make it public!






# Noter

Tired of trying and testing many notes taking app so decided to make my own...

Uses Tauri with Vite-React-Chakra frontend

## Setup

Make sure you have the following things installed: -

- git (to clone this project)
- rust
- nodejs
- pnpm

Then you just need to write `pnpm install` to install all the frontend dependencies.

After you are done with that, you can run the app using the following commands: -
- `pnpm dev` would run the app with frontend in browser
- `pnpm start` would run the app as a native application
